Hi. I'm a Unity 3D Developer.
I created this asset specialy for you.

Steps to get parallax effect:
1. Attach script ParalaxEffect.cs from /Assets/ParallaxEffect/Scripts/ folder to your Image like in Example scene.
2. You can use default values from inspector or set yours as you wish.

If you have any questions ask me an e-mail: genryselv@gmail.com.
Have a good day!
